    <article class="blog-content">
      <p>I just got back from AASA, and every year it&#39;s a reminder how valuable it is to hear directly from district leaders about what&#39;s actually top of mind. This year, the conversations felt more practical. Less about big new initiatives. More about building systems that actually hold up over time.</p>
<p>If I had to summarize the K-12 staffing conversation in one sentence, it&#39;s this: vacancies are still real, leadership development is getting more intentional, and substitutes are starting to be seen as part of the instructional and talent pipeline, not just coverage.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what stood out most to me.</p>
<h2>Persistent vacancies aren&#39;t going away</h2>
<p>Even with declining enrollment in some regions, staffing pressure hasn&#39;t really let up. Districts are still carrying thousands of teacher vacancies. The urgency is still there, but the tone is different than it was a few years ago. Leaders are talking less about emergency solutions and more about stability.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a growing focus on building pipelines that help districts attract, develop, and retain people over time instead of constantly restarting the search.</p>
<h2>Substitutes are moving from coverage to pipeline</h2>
<p>One idea that kept resurfacing was substitutes as an entry point into the profession.</p>
<p>We see this at Spur all the time. We&#39;ve placed more than a million substitutes over the last decade, and some of the strongest future teachers first walk into schools as subs. They discover they enjoy the work, build relationships with students and staff, and start to imagine a different path for themselves. The ones who stick around often become the best long-term hires a district makes.</p>
<p>I heard examples of teacher associate roles that give substitutes a clearer runway into teaching. It lowers the barrier to entry without lowering expectations, and it gives districts a chance to see someone in action before making a longer-term investment. It&#39;s a more intentional way to build a <a href="/blog/posts/building-substitute-teacher-pipeline.html">substitute teacher pipeline</a> than anything most districts had five years ago.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the part that doesn&#39;t get talked about enough. Most staffing vendors actually penalize districts for hiring their substitutes. The whole model is set up to keep people on the vendor&#39;s payroll, not to help districts build their own workforce.</p>
<p>We&#39;re leaning in the opposite direction. When a district &quot;poaches&quot; one of our people, we celebrate it. It means we did our job. We placed someone great, they proved themselves in the classroom, and the district wants to keep them. That&#39;s a win. We want to be part of a district&#39;s pipeline for great teaching talent, not actively working against it.</p>
<h2>Prepared substitutes help instruction keep moving</h2>
<p>Instructional quality remains front and center. That hasn&#39;t changed. What has shifted is how substitutes fit into that conversation.</p>
<p>If instruction matters every day, substitutes can&#39;t be an afterthought. There&#39;s a growing expectation that staffing partners help raise the level of preparation and context so classrooms don&#39;t stall every time a teacher is out.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not about replicating a full lesson perfectly. It&#39;s about continuity. Helping learning move forward, even a little, so teachers can actually take well-deserved time off without worrying about what they&#39;re coming back to.</p>
<h2>Leadership development is becoming more intentional</h2>
<p>Leadership came up everywhere, especially in larger districts.</p>
<p>One of the best sessions I sat in on featured Jasmine Kullar, Chief School Leadership Officer at Cobb County, and Dr. Corey D. Grubbs, Chief of Transformation and Innovation at Columbus City Schools. They were talking about what it actually takes to attract and keep your best people, and their framing stuck with me: talent isn&#39;t something you acquire, it&#39;s something you design for. How you attract people sends a signal. How you grow them builds trust. How you retain them reflects your culture. And how you reward them reveals what you truly value.</p>
<p>A few things stood out from that conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Cobb County</strong> invested $500,000 to fully fund advanced degrees for 200 educators. No debt, higher earning potential, and deep loyalty. It&#39;s hard to argue with the math. They&#39;ve also moved to a balanced calendar with full weeks off in September, November, February, and April to get ahead of burnout instead of reacting to it. And they use stay conversations with their strongest leaders to understand what&#39;s keeping them and what might cause them to leave.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Grubbs</strong> talked about Columbus City&#39;s &quot;Grow Your Own&quot; pipeline, funding paraprofessionals to get certified while they work. He also described a regional coaching model where the people supporting principals aren&#39;t the same people evaluating them. That distinction matters. Leaders need a safe space to be honest about what&#39;s hard without worrying it&#39;ll show up in a review.</p>
<p>Both of them also pushed on how districts hire. They&#39;ve moved from qualification-based to competency-based hiring, using real performance tasks in interviews instead of just Q&amp;A. Give a candidate an hour to prepare a presentation and you learn more about them in ten minutes than you would in a traditional interview.</p>
<p>Cobb&#39;s principal pipeline stood out. They&#39;re building leaders from within by training teaching leaders, developing assistant principals, and supporting principals once they step into the role. It&#39;s not a one-time initiative. It&#39;s a progression, and it&#39;s clearly tied to stability. Schools with strong leadership retain more staff, which means fewer vacancies to fill in the first place.</p>
<h2>The throughline: build pathways, not quick fixes</h2>
<p>Different districts, different geographies, all leaning toward the same idea. Build pipelines earlier. Invest in leadership. Treat substitute teaching as part of the long game.</p>
<p>Staffing is still messy. But the districts making real progress are building clearer pathways. From substitute to teacher. From teacher to leader. And from day-to-day staffing decisions to long-term stability for students and schools.</p>
