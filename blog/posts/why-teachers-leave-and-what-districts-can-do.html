    <article class="blog-content">
      <p>A teacher in your district is drafting a resignation letter right now. Not because they hate kids. Not because they found a higher-paying job. Because they feel unsupported, overworked, and invisible. And the worst part is that someone in your building probably knows it and has not done anything about it.</p>
<div class="direct-answer">

<p>Teachers leave primarily because of poor administrative support, lack of autonomy, and unsustainable workloads. Salary matters, but it ranks third or fourth in most surveys. The Learning Policy Institute estimates that teacher turnover costs districts over $20,000 per departing teacher when you factor in recruiting, hiring, and onboarding. Districts that meaningfully reduce turnover can save hundreds of thousands of dollars annually.</p>
</div>

<h2>What the data actually says</h2>
<p>The RAND Corporation surveyed over 5,000 teachers in 2021 and found that the top reasons for considering leaving were job-related stress, insufficient pay, and lack of administrative support. But here is the critical finding: among teachers who actually left, administrative support was the number one factor. Teachers will tolerate low pay if they feel supported. They will not tolerate high pay if they feel abandoned.</p>
<p>The National Center for Education Statistics reports that roughly 8% of teachers leave the profession each year, and another 8% move to different schools. That means a district of 1,000 teachers replaces approximately 160 every year. That is not a staffing challenge. That is a systems failure.</p>
<h2>5 things districts can do right now</h2>
<h3>1. Conduct stay interviews, not just exit interviews</h3>
<p>Exit interviews happen too late. The teacher has already decided to leave. Stay interviews happen while you can still change the outcome. Once per semester, have principals sit down with every teacher and ask three questions: What keeps you here? What might cause you to leave? What would make your job better?</p>
<p>This is not complicated. It requires 20 minutes per teacher and a genuine willingness to act on what you hear.</p>
<h3>2. Protect planning time like it is sacred</h3>
<p>Teachers report that loss of planning time is one of the most demoralizing aspects of the job. When subs cannot be found, who covers? When meetings get scheduled, whose prep period disappears? When a student needs supervision, who loses their only 45 minutes of uninterrupted work time?</p>
<p>Make planning time non-negotiable. Track how often it gets interrupted. Set a district standard: planning time should be preserved at least 90% of the time.</p>
<h3>3. Reduce the non-teaching workload</h3>
<p>Teachers did not sign up to fill out compliance forms, enter data into three different systems, attend meetings about meetings, and respond to parent emails at 10 PM. Every task you add without removing something else pushes a teacher closer to the door.</p>
<p>Audit the non-teaching demands on your teachers. For every new initiative, remove one existing requirement. This is not a suggestion. It is a survival strategy.</p>
<h3>4. Give teachers decision-making power in their classrooms</h3>
<p>Autonomy is a basic human need. Teachers who feel micromanaged by scripted curricula, pacing guides they did not help create, and administrative mandates about bulletin board displays are not going to stay. Trust your teachers to make professional decisions about instruction.</p>
<h3>5. Make the first three years survivable</h3>
<p>Nearly half of teachers who leave do so within their first five years. First-year teachers need mentors, reduced course loads, and someone who checks on them regularly. Not a form email. A human being who asks, &quot;How are you doing? What do you need?&quot;</p>
<div class="metrics-box">

<h2>What to measure</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Annual turnover rate</strong> by school, subject area, and experience level</li>
<li><strong>Reasons for departure</strong> categorized and tracked over time</li>
<li><strong>Stay interview completion rate</strong> (are principals actually doing them?)</li>
<li><strong>Planning time preservation rate</strong> (% of scheduled planning periods that go uninterrupted)</li>
<li><strong>First-year teacher retention</strong> (compare against district average)</li>
<li><strong>Teacher satisfaction scores</strong> on working conditions surveys</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="mistakes-box">

<h2>Common mistakes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Throwing money at the problem without fixing culture.</strong> Bonuses help. But a $5,000 retention bonus does not make up for a toxic principal.</li>
<li><strong>Treating turnover as inevitable.</strong> &quot;Teachers leave, that is just how it is&quot; is a choice, not a fact. Districts with strong cultures retain 90%+ of their teachers annually.</li>
<li><strong>Ignoring the principal factor.</strong> Teachers do not leave districts. They leave buildings. If one school has 25% turnover and the neighboring school has 5%, the variable is leadership.</li>
<li><strong>Surveying teachers and then doing nothing.</strong> This is worse than not surveying. It teaches teachers that their voice does not matter.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p><strong>If you only do one thing this week:</strong> Pick five teachers who you think might be at risk of leaving. Not the ones who complain loudly. The quiet ones who used to volunteer for everything and stopped. Ask them how they are doing. Listen. Then do something about what they tell you.</p>
