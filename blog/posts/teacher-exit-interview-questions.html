    <article class="blog-content">
      <p>&quot;Why are you leaving?&quot; &quot;I got a better opportunity.&quot; &quot;What could we have done differently?&quot; &quot;Nothing, it was just time.&quot; &quot;Would you recommend this district?&quot; &quot;Of course.&quot;</p>
<p>That is how most teacher exit interviews go. The departing teacher is polite, vague, and eager to leave on good terms. The district learns nothing actionable. The same problems that drove the teacher out continue driving others out. The cycle repeats.</p>
<p>Exit interviews can be the most valuable data source a district has for understanding and reducing turnover. But only if you ask the right questions in the right way.</p>
<div class="direct-answer">

<p>Effective teacher exit interviews produce actionable data about the specific, addressable factors that drive turnover. The keys to getting honest, useful responses are: conducting the interview after the teacher&#39;s last day (when they no longer fear consequences), asking specific behavioral questions rather than general opinion questions, using a consistent protocol across all exits, and assuring confidentiality of individual responses while aggregating themes for leadership. Districts that implement structured exit interview programs identify building-specific retention problems, systemic issues, and fixable dissatisfiers that generic surveys miss.</p>
</div>

<h2>Why most exit interviews fail</h2>
<h3>They happen too early</h3>
<p>An interview on the teacher&#39;s last day, while they are still navigating final paperwork and maintaining relationships, produces diplomatic answers. Conduct the interview two to four weeks after departure. The teacher is emotionally detached enough to be honest and far enough removed to have perspective.</p>
<h3>They ask the wrong questions</h3>
<p>&quot;Why are you leaving?&quot; invites a single, simple answer: money, location, opportunity. The real reasons are almost always more complex and more useful. Replace broad questions with specific ones that probe actual experiences and decisions.</p>
<h3>The data is not always acted upon</h3>
<p>Exit interview responses are most valuable when they inform action. Aggregate exit data quarterly. Identify patterns. Report findings to district leadership. Assign someone to act on the findings.</p>
<h2>The questions that reveal the truth</h2>
<h3>About their daily experience</h3>
<p><strong>&quot;Describe a typical Tuesday in your school. Walk me through the day.&quot;</strong> This question reveals workload, time usage, and daily satisfaction without asking directly about any of them. Listen for: how much time is spent on instruction vs. non-instructional tasks, the level of autonomy, the pace and stress level.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;What was the best part of your week, most weeks?&quot;</strong> This reveals what kept them coming back, and by implication, what was not strong enough to retain them.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;What was the most frustrating recurring problem you faced?&quot;</strong> &quot;Recurring&quot; is the key word. One-time frustrations are forgettable. Recurring ones drive people out.</p>
<h3>About leadership and support</h3>
<p><strong>&quot;When you needed support from your administration, what did that look like? Can you give me a specific example?&quot;</strong> Specific examples reveal whether support was real or theoretical. Listen for: response time, follow-through, and whether the teacher felt backed up.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;How were decisions made that affected your work? Were you consulted?&quot;</strong> This reveals whether teachers had voice. Listen for: top-down vs. collaborative decision-making, whether input was solicited, whether input mattered.</p>
<h3>About the decision to leave</h3>
<p><strong>&quot;When did you first start thinking about leaving? What was happening at that time?&quot;</strong> The timing reveals the trigger. Was it September exhaustion? January burnout? A specific event? A change in circumstances? The trigger is often the most actionable piece of data.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;What would have needed to change for you to stay?&quot;</strong> This is the gold question. It reveals the specific, often fixable factor that tipped the decision. &quot;If I had 15 fewer students in my class.&quot; &quot;If my principal had supported me with that parent.&quot; &quot;If I had one more planning period per week.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>&quot;If a friend were considering a job in this district, what would you tell them honestly?&quot;</strong> This question, asked last, often produces the most candid assessment of the district.</p>
<h3>About what comes next</h3>
<p><strong>&quot;What does your new position offer that this one did not?&quot;</strong> The comparison reveals the specific gaps: salary, working conditions, support, growth opportunities, or something else entirely.</p>
<h2>Processing and using exit data</h2>
<h3>Aggregate quarterly</h3>
<p>Individual exit interviews are anecdotes. Aggregated exit data is intelligence. Every quarter, compile the responses. Code them by theme: workload, leadership, compensation, working conditions, growth opportunities. Identify the top three themes.</p>
<h3>Report to leadership</h3>
<p>Present aggregated exit data to district leadership quarterly. Protect individual confidentiality but share the patterns. &quot;Twelve of our 18 departing teachers cited lack of administrative support as a factor. Six specifically mentioned the same building.&quot;</p>
<h3>Track changes over time</h3>
<p>Are the same themes appearing year after year? That indicates systemic issues that are not being addressed. Are new themes emerging? That might indicate a response to recent policy changes.</p>
<div class="metrics-box">

<h2>What to measure</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exit interview completion rate</strong> (what percentage of departing teachers participate?)</li>
<li><strong>Top three departure themes by quarter</strong> (are they consistent or changing?)</li>
<li><strong>Building-specific patterns</strong> (do exits cluster at particular schools?)</li>
<li><strong>Actionable findings per quarter</strong> (how many specific, implementable recommendations emerge?)</li>
<li><strong>Follow-through rate</strong> (of recommendations made, how many were acted on?)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="mistakes-box">

<h2>Common mistakes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conducting the interview on the last day.</strong> Wait two to four weeks. Candor increases with distance.</li>
<li><strong>Asking only &quot;why are you leaving?&quot;</strong> This produces a single, often misleading answer. Use multiple specific questions to get the full picture.</li>
<li><strong>Not aggregating the data.</strong> Individual interviews are stories. Aggregated data is strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Collecting data without acting on it.</strong> If exit interview themes persist for three consecutive quarters without response, the process is performative.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you only do one thing this week:</strong> Review the exit interview data from your last five departing teachers. If you do not have exit interview data, that is your first problem. If you do, identify the one theme that appears most often. That theme is where your retention strategy should start.</p>
