    <article class="blog-content">
      <p>Your fill rate is 72%. Maybe 68%. You check it every Monday morning, and every Monday morning it makes your stomach drop. The classrooms without subs get covered by your already-stretched teachers, your instructional coaches, your assistant principals. Everyone pretends this is fine. It is not fine.</p>
<div class="direct-answer">

<p>A healthy substitute fill rate is one where the vast majority of absences are covered. Many districts fall well short of that benchmark. The gap between where you are and where you need to be comes down to three things: how fast you post jobs, how easy you make it for subs to say yes, and whether the experience is good enough that they come back.</p>
</div>

<h2>The fill rate problem is a speed problem</h2>
<p>Here is what happens in most districts. A teacher calls in sick at 5:45 AM. The absence gets entered into the system. The system sends out notifications. By the time a substitute sees the job, it is 6:30 AM and they have already committed to another district. Or they see it and pass because the school is 40 minutes away and the last time they worked there, nobody told them where the bathroom was.</p>
<p>Speed is the single biggest factor in fill rates. Districts that post absences the evening before see fill rates jump 15 to 20 percentage points. That is the difference between chaos and coverage.</p>
<h2>5 steps to get your fill rate above 90%</h2>
<h3>1. Post absences as early as humanly possible</h3>
<p>If a teacher knows on Tuesday that they will be out on Thursday, that absence should be in the system on Tuesday night. Build a culture where planned absences get entered 48 hours in advance. For day-of sick calls, push your call-in window earlier. A 5:00 AM deadline instead of 6:00 AM gives your subs an extra hour to respond.</p>
<p>Set a district goal: 70% of absences entered the day before. Track it weekly. Share the numbers with building principals.</p>
<h3>2. Reduce friction in the acceptance process</h3>
<p>Every extra click between a sub seeing a job and accepting it costs you fill rate points. Audit your substitute management platform. How many steps does it take to accept a job? Can subs accept from their phone? Do they get push notifications or just emails?</p>
<p>One mid-size district in Ohio switched from email-only notifications to push notifications with one-tap acceptance. Fill rate went from 71% to 88% in one semester. The jobs did not change. The speed of connection changed.</p>
<h3>3. Build preferred-sub lists at the building level</h3>
<p>Principals and office managers know which subs work well in their buildings. Formalize that knowledge. Create a preferred-sub list for each school, and give those subs first crack at openings before jobs go to the general pool.</p>
<p>This works because it creates a relationship. Subs who feel connected to a school fill jobs there more reliably. They know the routines. They know the parking situation.</p>
<h3>4. Fix the worst buildings first</h3>
<p>You already know which schools have the lowest fill rates. In almost every district, fill rate problems concentrate in a handful of buildings. Pull the data. Sort your schools by fill rate. The bottom five need immediate attention.</p>
<p>Visit those buildings. Talk to subs who have worked there and subs who refuse to work there. You will hear the same things: no lesson plans, rude front office staff, no break, disruptive student behavior with zero admin support. These are fixable problems. Fix them.</p>
<h3>5. Pay attention to day-of-week and seasonal patterns</h3>
<p>Pull your fill rate data by day of week and by month. Mondays and Fridays are almost always worse. Dips around holidays and in spring are predictable.</p>
<p>Consider differential pay for hard-to-fill days. A $15 bump for Friday assignments costs less than the instructional time lost when a classroom goes uncovered. Some districts offer a &quot;reliability bonus&quot; for subs who fill a minimum number of jobs per month.</p>
<div class="metrics-box">

<h2>What to measure</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overall fill rate</strong> (weekly and monthly, target: 90%+)</li>
<li><strong>Fill rate by building</strong> (identify your bottom five)</li>
<li><strong>Time-to-fill</strong> (hours between absence posting and job acceptance)</li>
<li><strong>Advance posting rate</strong> (% of absences posted the day before or earlier)</li>
<li><strong>Repeat rate</strong> (% of subs who work more than one assignment per month)</li>
<li><strong>Day-of-week fill rate</strong> (spot patterns before they become crises)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="mistakes-box">

<h2>Common mistakes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Treating fill rate as an HR problem instead of an operations problem.</strong> HR recruits subs into the pool. Operations gets them into classrooms. A big pool with bad processes still produces low fill rates.</li>
<li><strong>Ignoring the sub experience at the building level.</strong> You can recruit 200 new subs, but if your schools treat them poorly, those subs will work for a neighboring district instead.</li>
<li><strong>Raising pay without fixing systems.</strong> Pay matters, but a district paying $120/day with great systems will outperform a district paying $150/day where jobs post at 6:30 AM.</li>
<li><strong>Not tracking the data at all.</strong> If you are not measuring fill rate weekly by building, you are guessing. Stop guessing.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p><strong>If you only do one thing this week:</strong> Pull your fill rate data by building, sort it lowest to highest, and visit the bottom three schools. Ask the front office staff what happens when a sub shows up. Ask a sub what happened last time they worked there. The gap between those two stories is where your fill rate lives.</p>
