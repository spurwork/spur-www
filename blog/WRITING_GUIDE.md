# Spur Education Blog: Editorial Standards Guide

This is the rulebook. Every post published on the Spur blog follows these standards. No exceptions.

---

## 1. Voice and Tone

Write like you are explaining something important to a smart colleague over coffee. Not a keynote. Not a whitepaper.

- Use plain language. If a simpler word exists, use it.
- Keep paragraphs short. Two to four sentences max.
- Write short sentences. If a sentence has more than 25 words, split it.
- Be confident. State your position. Do not hedge with "we believe" or "it could be argued."
- Never use em dashes. Use periods or commas.
- Avoid passive voice. Say who did what.
- No motivational language. No "inspiring the next generation." Describe what actually happens.
- No filler intros. Do not open with "In today's fast-paced world." Start with the problem.
- No throat-clearing. The first sentence should earn the reader's attention.

**The test:** Read your draft out loud. If you sound like a person talking, good. If you sound like a press release, rewrite it.

## 2. Author Voice Rules

### Rob Magliano, VP of Sales

Rob sounds like a field operator who just got back from visiting three districts.

- Punchy and direct. Short sentences. Strong verbs.
- Opens with hooks from real conversations. "I was in a district last month where the superintendent told me they lost 40 subs in one semester."
- Uses "What I'm hearing from districts" framing naturally.
- Vivid, concrete details. Not abstract principles.
- Comfortable with urgency.

**Rob sounds like:** "Three districts told me the same thing last quarter. They can not find subs. Not 'it's harder than it used to be.' They literally can not fill the positions. Here is what the ones who figured it out are doing differently."

### Donnie Decker, COO

Donnie is the systems thinker. He sees how pieces connect.

- Calm, confident, precise. Never rushed.
- Structures arguments with numbered lists and frameworks.
- Names the system before fixing the part.
- Conversational but organized. Every paragraph earns its place.
- Comfortable with complexity. Does not oversimplify.

**Donnie sounds like:** "Most districts treat substitute staffing as a hiring problem. It is not. It is a systems problem with four moving parts: supply, matching, retention, and feedback. Fix them in that order."

### Crystal DiFrancesca, VP of HR

Crystal writes about people. She cares about worker experience, dignity, and clarity.

- Warm and clear. Never cold, never sentimental.
- Empathetic but practical. Acknowledges feelings, then moves to solutions.
- Focuses on what workers actually experience.
- Direct about hard truths. Does not soften bad news into mush.
- Strong on fairness, process, and communication.

**Crystal sounds like:** "Your substitute teachers talk to each other. If one of them has a bad experience at your school, ten others hear about it before lunch. The question is not whether word spreads. It is what word you want spreading."

### Gary Henderson, President, ALABS

Gary is the program builder. He has built things that work.

- Optimistic and pragmatic. Believes in solutions because he has seen them work.
- "Here is how this plays out on the ground" is his natural frame.
- Concrete and specific. Talks in terms of what happens Monday morning.
- Strong on implementation details.
- Uses real examples from real programs.

**Gary sounds like:** "I have seen this model work in four different states. The common thread is not budget or politics. It is having one person who owns the rollout and meets with principals weekly for the first 90 days."

## 6. Good vs. Bad Examples

### Opening a Post

**Bad:** "In today's rapidly evolving educational landscape, school districts across the nation are facing unprecedented challenges when it comes to securing qualified substitute teachers."

**Good:** "Last year, the average U.S. school district failed to fill 25% of its substitute teacher requests. That means one in four classrooms had no teacher. This is fixable."

### Describing a Solution

**Bad:** "Districts should leverage innovative technology solutions to empower their HR teams and transform the substitute staffing experience."

**Good:** "Use an automated matching system. When a teacher logs an absence, the system texts available subs ranked by fit: same school, same grade, same subject. This fills 30% more positions than a manual phone tree."

### Citing Evidence

**Bad:** "Studies show that substitute teacher quality has a significant impact on student outcomes."

**Good:** "A 2017 study in the Journal of Education Finance found that students with long-term substitutes scored 3-5 percentile points lower on standardized math assessments (Gershenson, 2017)."

### Giving Advice

**Bad:** "It is important for district leaders to think holistically about their approach to substitute teacher retention."

**Good:** "Pay subs within five business days. Give them a parking spot. Tell them where the bathroom is. In a 2022 survey of 1,200 substitutes, 'feeling respected at the school' was the top predictor of whether a sub would return."

### Closing a Section

**Bad:** "By taking these steps, districts can begin their journey toward a more robust and scalable substitute staffing solution."

**Good:** "These five steps will not fix your sub shortage overnight. But districts that implement all five typically see fill rates improve by 10-20% within one semester. Start with step one. It takes an afternoon."

## 7. "Not Controversial" Rules

1. **Focus on outcomes.** "Districts that did X saw Y result."
2. **Focus on operations.** Staffing, scheduling, fill rates, retention, pay.
3. **Focus on evidence.** Let the data persuade.
4. **Avoid hot-button political framing.**
5. **Do not tell people what to believe.** Tell them what the data says.
6. **If unsure, stick to the data.**
7. **Name the tradeoffs.** Every policy has them.
8. **Do not punch down.** Critique systems, not people.
9. **Respect local context.** What works in urban may not work in rural.
