You launched an after-school program. Enrollment is strong. Families are grateful. And your staff is exhausted. Three of your best facilitators just quit because they found jobs with benefits. Your site coordinator is working 60-hour weeks. This is not sustainable, and you know it.

<div class="direct-answer">

After-school program staffing works when you treat it as a workforce system, not a gig. That means competitive hourly rates benchmarked against local alternatives, predictable scheduling at least two weeks in advance, real onboarding (not just a handbook), and a clear path to more hours or full-time roles. Programs that retain 80%+ of their staff year-over-year share these four characteristics.

## Why after-school staffing is harder than it looks

After-school positions compete with retail, food service, and gig work for the same labor pool. The hours are limited (typically 2:30-6:00 PM). Benefits are rare. And the work is demanding: managing groups of children who have already sat through a full school day.

The Afterschool Alliance reports that staffing is the number one challenge cited by after-school program directors, ahead of funding and space. The programs that solve it treat staffing as a strategic function, not an afterthought.

## 5 steps to build a stable after-school team

### 1. Benchmark your pay against real competition

Your competition is not other after-school programs. It is Target, DoorDash, and the Amazon warehouse down the street. Pull hourly rates for those employers in your area and make sure your starting rate is within range. If DoorDash pays $18/hour with full flexibility and you are offering $14/hour with a fixed schedule, you will lose every time.

### 2. Offer predictable schedules posted at least two weeks out

Part-time workers value schedule predictability almost as much as pay. Post schedules a minimum of two weeks in advance. Minimize last-minute changes. When changes are necessary, communicate directly and offer alternatives.

### 3. Create a real onboarding experience

A 30-minute building tour is not onboarding. Your after-school staff need training in behavior management, activity facilitation, safety protocols, and your specific program model. Invest two to three full days of paid training before the program starts. This reduces early turnover and improves program quality.

### 4. Build pathways to more hours and responsibility

Your best after-school staff want more. Create a tiered structure: activity facilitator, senior facilitator, site coordinator. Each tier comes with more hours, more pay, and more responsibility. Pair this with tuition assistance for staff pursuing education degrees, and you have built a grow-your-own teacher pipeline that also solves your after-school staffing problem.

### 5. Recruit from the community you serve

Parents, retired teachers, college students, and community members with relevant skills are your best candidates. They already care about the neighborhood. They are invested in the kids. And they are more likely to stay because the work connects to something they value beyond a paycheck.

## What to measure

- **Staff retention rate** (% of staff who return for a second program cycle)
- **Time-to-fill for open positions** (target: under 14 days)
- **Staff satisfaction survey scores** (quarterly)
- **Ratio of staff to students** (maintain your program's target ratio consistently)
- **Training hours completed per staff member**

<div class="mistakes-box">

## Common mistakes

- **Paying below market and expecting loyalty.** Passion does not pay rent. If your rate is not competitive, your best people will leave.
- **Treating after-school staff as lesser employees.** If your after-school team does not get the same respect, communication, and support as your day staff, they will notice.
- **Relying on a single site coordinator to do everything.** If one person leaving can collapse your program, your structure is too fragile.
- **Not training for behavior management.** After-school hours are when behavioral challenges peak. Untrained staff cannot handle it.

**If you only do one thing this week:** Survey your after-school staff anonymously with one question: "What would make you more likely to come back next year?" Their answers will tell you exactly what to fix first.
