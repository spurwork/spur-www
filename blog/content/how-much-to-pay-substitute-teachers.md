I hear the same question in every district I visit: "How much should we pay subs?" And I always give the same answer: "More than the district next door. But that alone will not fix your problem."

<div class="direct-answer">

The national average daily rate for substitute teachers is approximately $130-$150 per day, but rates vary dramatically by region. Urban districts typically pay $140-$200. Rural districts often pay $90-$120. The right rate for your district is the one that keeps your active pool large enough to maintain an 85%+ fill rate. Pay is necessary but not sufficient. Districts that raise pay without fixing systems see temporary bumps that fade within a semester.

## The pay landscape in 2025

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports the median hourly wage for substitute teachers at $16.29 nationally. But that number hides enormous variation. A sub in the Bay Area might earn $250/day. A sub in rural Mississippi might earn $75.

Three data points matter for setting your rate:

1. **What neighboring districts pay.** Subs are mobile. They will drive 20 minutes to earn $20 more per day.
2. **What local alternatives pay.** Your competition is retail, food service, and gig work, not just other districts.
3. **What your fill rate tells you.** If your fill rate is above 90%, your pay is probably adequate. If it is below 75%, pay is likely part of the problem.

## How to determine the right rate

### 1. Survey your market

Call five neighboring districts and ask their daily sub rate. Check Indeed, Glassdoor, and local job boards for comparable part-time hourly work. Calculate what your rate translates to per hour (divide daily rate by typical hours worked, usually 6.5-7).

If your hourly equivalent is below the local Walmart starting wage, you have a pay problem.

### 2. Consider tiered pay structures

Flat daily rates treat all assignments the same. They are not. A long-term sub covering a maternity leave for six weeks brings far more value than a day-of fill. Consider a tiered model:

- **Daily rate:** Standard rate for day-to-day assignments
- **Long-term rate:** 15-25% premium for assignments over 10 consecutive days
- **Hard-to-fill premium:** Extra $15-25 for specific schools, subjects, or days (Fridays, Mondays)

### 3. Add non-monetary incentives

Some districts cannot raise pay due to budget constraints. Non-monetary incentives still matter: guaranteed parking spots, free lunch from the cafeteria, access to the staff lounge, and professional development credits. These cost little and signal respect.

### 4. Model the cost before you raise rates

A $10/day increase across 500 sub-days per month costs $5,000/month or $45,000/year. Compare that to the cost of uncovered classrooms: pulled instructional coaches ($50-70/hour), lost prep periods for teachers, and the morale cost of chronic coverage gaps. The math usually favors the raise.

## What to measure

- **Your daily rate vs. neighboring districts** (benchmark quarterly)
- **Hourly equivalent vs. local alternatives** (retail, gig, food service)
- **Fill rate response to pay changes** (measure for two semesters after any adjustment)
- **Cost per sub-day vs. cost per uncovered classroom** (build the ROI case)
- **Active pool size trend** (is your pool growing or shrinking after rate changes?)

<div class="mistakes-box">

## Common mistakes

- **Raising pay and expecting permanent results.** Pay increases boost fill rates for 2-3 months. Then they become the new normal and other factors reassert themselves.
- **Setting rates once and never adjusting.** The labor market changes. Review your rate at least annually.
- **Ignoring total compensation.** A district paying $140/day with fast onboarding, good schools, and timely pay is more attractive than a district paying $160/day with slow onboarding and poor building experiences.
- **Not communicating pay increases.** If you raise rates, tell your subs. Send a direct message. Post it on your website. Make sure the market knows.

**If you only do one thing this week:** Calculate your current daily sub rate as an hourly wage. Compare it to the starting wage at your three closest big-box retailers. If you are below retail, you know where to start the budget conversation.
