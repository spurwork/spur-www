The substitute teacher shortage is not new. But it is worse than it has ever been. Pre-pandemic, the average district fill rate was around 90%. Today, many districts hover between 70% and 80%. Some dip below 60% on peak absence days. The traditional recruitment playbook, post a listing and wait, is broken. Here is what is working instead.

<div class="direct-answer">

Districts with the strongest substitute pools recruit from non-traditional sources: retired professionals, college students, stay-at-home parents returning to work, career changers, and gig economy workers. The most effective recruitment strategies treat sub recruitment like a year-round marketing campaign rather than a one-time job posting. Districts that maintain active recruitment efforts throughout the school year see 15-25% larger active pools than those that recruit only in August. Speed matters too: the time between application and first classroom assignment should be under two weeks.

## Where to find substitute teachers

### 1. College students

Education majors are the obvious pool, but do not stop there. Students studying psychology, social work, communications, and liberal arts often make excellent subs and want flexible work that fits around their class schedules.

Partner with your local university's career services office. Offer to present at student job fairs. Create a streamlined onboarding path specifically for college students with flexible scheduling and digital-first processes.

### 2. Retired professionals

Retired teachers are the gold standard, but retired professionals from any field can be effective subs, especially at the secondary level. A retired engineer subbing for a math class brings real-world relevance. A retired nurse subbing for a health class brings experience students find compelling.

Recruit through senior centers, community organizations, and retirement communities. Emphasize the flexibility and purpose of the work.

### 3. Stay-at-home parents

Parents whose children are in school often have six available hours per day and want meaningful, flexible work. The school calendar alignment is a natural fit. Recruit at PTA meetings, school events, and parent volunteer programs. Some of your most reliable future subs are already in your buildings as volunteers.

### 4. Gig economy workers

Rideshare drivers, freelancers, and gig workers value schedule flexibility above all else. Position substitute teaching as a gig that pays comparably, offers consistent availability, and contributes to the community. These candidates respond to mobile-first application processes and same-week scheduling.

### 5. Career changers exploring education

Some people are considering a teaching career but are not ready to commit to a certification program. Substitute teaching is the perfect test drive. Market it that way. "Thinking about teaching? Try it as a sub first." This message resonates with career changers and creates a pipeline to full-time teaching.

## How to recruit them

### Speed up your onboarding

If your application-to-classroom timeline is longer than two weeks, you are losing candidates to faster-moving employers. Audit every step: application, background check, interview or orientation, first assignment. Remove every unnecessary delay.

Many districts require in-person orientations held once a month. If a candidate applies on September 2nd, they wait until October 1st for orientation. That is a month of lost availability. Offer weekly orientations or create a digital orientation option.

### Recruit year-round

August recruitment drives produce a surge of new subs. By November, half of them have stopped accepting assignments. Meanwhile, potential subs who become interested in October have no easy way to join.

Treat recruitment like a faucet, not a frenzy. Maintain a permanent "Become a Sub" page on your website. Run social media posts monthly. Keep the application open 365 days a year.

### Make it easy to say yes

Every friction point in your process costs you candidates. Required in-person fingerprinting at one location during business hours? That eliminates anyone with a day job. Four-page paper application? That eliminates anyone under 30. Mandatory unpaid training day? That eliminates anyone who cannot afford to volunteer a day.

Make every step digital, fast, and flexible.

## What to measure

- **Application-to-first-assignment time** (under two weeks is the target)
- **Source of hire** (which channels produce the most active subs?)
- **Pool activation rate** (of those who complete onboarding, what percentage accept at least one assignment?)
- **Pool growth vs. attrition** (is your pool growing or shrinking month over month?)
- **Cost per recruit** (total recruitment spending divided by new active subs)

<div class="mistakes-box">

## Common mistakes

- **Only recruiting in August.** Your pool shrinks all year. Your recruitment should be continuous.
- **Requiring unnecessary credentials.** Many states allow non-certified substitutes. If your district adds requirements beyond state minimums, you are shrinking your own pool.
- **Making onboarding slow and painful.** Every extra week between application and first assignment loses candidates.
- **Not following up with inactive subs.** A sub who has not worked in 60 days needs a phone call, not a deactivation notice. "We have not seen you in a while. Is there anything we can do to get you back?"

**If you only do one thing this week:** Time your current application-to-first-assignment process. Apply as a mystery shopper and track every step. If it takes more than 14 days, you now know your biggest recruitment bottleneck.
