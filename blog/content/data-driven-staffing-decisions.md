Every district has data. Absence reports, fill rate logs, payroll records, teacher turnover numbers. The problem is not a lack of data. The problem is that most of this data sits in separate systems, gets reviewed once a year for a board presentation, and never informs a single operational decision in between.

<div class="direct-answer">

Data-driven staffing means using real-time and historical data to predict staffing needs, allocate resources, and evaluate the effectiveness of staffing strategies. Districts that implement data-driven staffing practices see measurable improvements: higher fill rates through predictive absence modeling, reduced overtime and emergency staffing costs, and faster identification of staffing problems before they become crises. The starting point is not sophisticated analytics. It is simply looking at the data you already have on a weekly basis and asking "what is this telling us?"

</div>

## The data you already have (and are not using)

### Absence data

Your absence management system contains patterns you have never examined. Which day of the week has the highest absence rate? Which month? Which buildings? Which departments? A simple pivot table on last year's absence data reveals predictable patterns you can staff ahead of.

Most districts find that Mondays and Fridays have 30-50% higher absence rates than midweek days. Professional development days adjacent to weekends create spikes. The week before winter break is consistently high. None of this is surprising, but few districts proactively adjust their sub pool availability for these known spikes.

### Fill rate data

Your fill rate is not a single number. It is a distribution. Some schools fill at 95%. Others at 65%. Some periods fill easily. Others never do. Breaking your fill rate down by building, day of week, grade level, and subject area reveals exactly where your gaps are, and where your resources should be focused.

### Turnover data

When do teachers leave? Not just the calendar month, but how many years in? What building were they at? What subject did they teach? Turnover is not random. It follows patterns that data can reveal and strategy can address.

### Substitute pool data

How many subs are in your active pool? How many accepted an assignment in the last 30 days? 60 days? 90 days? What is your pool utilization rate? A pool of 200 subs where only 80 are active is really a pool of 80 with 120 names on a list.

## Building a weekly data practice

### Step 1: Create a staffing dashboard

You do not need expensive software. A shared spreadsheet updated weekly with five numbers is enough to start:

1. This week's absence count
2. This week's fill rate
3. Active sub pool size
4. Open positions (teacher vacancies)
5. Number of classrooms covered by non-teaching staff

Update these five numbers every Friday. Review them every Monday morning. That rhythm alone will surface problems weeks before they become emergencies.

### Step 2: Look for patterns monthly

Once a month, pull the last 30 days of data and ask three questions: What is getting better? What is getting worse? What surprised us? This does not require a data analyst. It requires one person spending 30 minutes with a spreadsheet and a curious mind.

### Step 3: Predict quarterly

Use last year's data to predict next quarter's needs. If November historically has 20% higher absence rates, start recruiting additional subs in September. If January through March is your peak turnover period, accelerate hiring timelines in November.

### Step 4: Evaluate annually

At the end of each school year, evaluate your staffing strategies against the data. Did the pay increase improve fill rates? Did the mentorship program reduce first-year turnover? Did the attendance recovery program re-engage chronically absent students? Data tells you what worked, not anecdotes.

## What to measure

- **Weekly fill rate trend** (is it improving, declining, or stable?)
- **Absence rate by day of week and month** (identify predictable patterns)
- **Pool activation rate** (percentage of onboarded subs who work at least once per month)
- **Cost per unfilled absence** (calculate the true cost of uncovered classrooms)
- **Time to fill teacher vacancies** (from posting to first day in classroom)

</div>

<div class="mistakes-box">

## Common mistakes

- **Collecting data without reviewing it.** Data that sits in a system and is never examined has zero value.
- **Reviewing data annually instead of weekly.** Staffing problems develop over weeks, not years. Your data review cadence should match.
- **Focusing on averages instead of distributions.** A 85% district fill rate hides the building at 60%. Look at the range, not just the mean.
- **Investing in analytics tools before building the habit.** A $50,000 dashboard that nobody checks is worse than a free spreadsheet that someone updates every Friday.

</div>

**If you only do one thing this week:** Open your absence management system and export last month's data. Sort by building. Identify the three schools with the highest absence rates and the three with the lowest. Ask yourself: do you know why? If not, the data just gave you your first investigation.
