Most districts can tell you how many substitute teachers are in their pool. Almost none can tell you which subs are good. This is not a minor blind spot. It is the reason your best subs leave, your worst subs keep getting assignments, and your teachers dread being absent.

<div class="direct-answer">

Effective substitute performance tracking requires three components: a consistent feedback mechanism after every assignment, a simple scoring system that accumulates over time, and an action protocol that differentiates how you treat high and low performers. The system does not need to be sophisticated. A three-question post-assignment survey sent to the returning teacher, aggregated in a spreadsheet, and reviewed monthly will give you more actionable intelligence than most districts have ever had about their substitute pool.

</div>

## The three-question survey

After every substitute assignment, send the returning teacher a brief survey. Three questions are enough:

**Question 1: Were lesson plans followed?** (Yes / Partially / No)

**Question 2: How was classroom management?** (Excellent / Adequate / Poor)

**Question 3: Would you want this sub again?** (Definitely / Maybe / No)

That is it. This takes the returning teacher less than 30 seconds. If you add more questions, completion rates drop and you get less data, not more. Keep it short.

## Aggregating the data

### Create a sub scorecard

For each substitute, maintain a running scorecard with:
- Total assignments completed
- Average score across all three questions (convert to a 1-3 scale for each)
- Trend line (improving, stable, or declining)
- Notable comments (positive or negative)

Update this monthly. A simple spreadsheet works. If you have an absence management platform, most can handle this.

### Set thresholds

Define what "good" and "concerning" look like in your scoring system. For example:
- Average score above 2.5: Preferred sub status
- Average score 2.0-2.5: Solid performer, standard assignments
- Average score below 2.0 after five or more assignments: Performance conversation needed
- Any single assignment with all "Poor/No" ratings: Immediate follow-up

### Review monthly

Once per month, a staffing coordinator should review the scorecards and take three actions:
1. Recognize the top 10% of performers with a thank-you call or message
2. Identify any subs who have dropped below the performance threshold
3. Schedule coaching conversations with underperformers

## Acting on the data

### For high performers

Give them priority access to assignments. Offer them first pick of long-term placements. Include them in professional development opportunities. Send a quarterly note of appreciation. These actions cost almost nothing and powerfully retain your best people.

### For underperformers

Start with a conversation, not a termination. Most performance issues stem from lack of training, not lack of effort. A sub who struggles with classroom management may never have been taught de-escalation techniques. A sub who does not follow lesson plans may not understand the teacher's format.

Provide targeted support: a mentoring session with a veteran sub, a classroom management workshop, or a ride-along day where they shadow a high-performing sub. Give them 30 days and five assignments to improve. Then review again.

### For persistent poor performers

If a sub receives consistent low ratings over multiple assignments despite coaching and support, remove them from the active pool. This is uncomfortable but necessary. Keeping poor performers active erodes teacher trust in the entire substitute program and drives away the good subs who see that quality does not matter.

## Getting teacher buy-in

Teachers will only complete the survey if they believe it matters. Two strategies ensure compliance:

**Close the loop.** When a teacher reports a poor sub experience and you take action, tell the teacher. "Thank you for your feedback about the sub on Tuesday. We have followed up and will not be assigning that individual to your building again." That response guarantees the teacher will complete every future survey.

**Show results.** Share aggregate data with staff. "Our average sub rating improved from 2.1 to 2.4 this semester thanks to your feedback." Progress demonstrates that the system works.

## What to measure

- **Survey completion rate** (target 70%+ of assignments receiving feedback)
- **Average sub rating across the district** (track the trend monthly)
- **Rating distribution** (what percentage of subs are rated excellent, adequate, or poor?)
- **Coaching conversation outcomes** (do underperformers improve after intervention?)
- **High-performer retention rate** (are your best subs staying active?)

</div>

<div class="mistakes-box">

## Common mistakes

- **Making the survey too long.** Three questions, 30 seconds. That is the target. More than that kills completion rates.
- **Collecting data and not acting on it.** If poor ratings trigger no response, teachers stop providing feedback.
- **Using the data punitively without offering support first.** Coaching before consequences. Always.
- **Not recognizing high performers.** If good subs receive no acknowledgment while poor subs receive no consequences, you are incentivizing mediocrity.

**If you only do one thing this week:** Create a three-question Google Form. Send it to every teacher who had a sub this week. Read the responses. You will learn more about your substitute program in one week than most districts learn in a year.
