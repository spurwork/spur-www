Your substitute teacher pool is shrinking. Not because you stopped recruiting. Because you built a bucket, not a pipeline. You pour people in at the start of the year and watch them drain out the bottom. By February, you are back to scrambling.

<div class="direct-answer">

A sustainable substitute pipeline requires four components operating simultaneously: continuous recruitment (not just September pushes), streamlined onboarding (under 10 business days from application to classroom), active retention practices, and a feedback loop that identifies why subs leave or go inactive. Districts that treat their sub pool as a managed workforce, not a contact list, maintain fill rates above 85% through the spring semester.

## The four parts of a working pipeline

Most districts think of substitute recruitment as an event. It should be a system. Here is how to think about it.

### 1. Continuous recruitment, not seasonal campaigns

Your pipeline loses 20-30% of its subs between September and January. Some find full-time jobs. Some move. Some decide the pay is not worth it. If you only recruit in the fall, you start every spring behind.

Set up a year-round recruitment engine. Partner with local colleges for student teachers who need classroom hours. Post on community job boards monthly. Ask your best subs to refer friends. Create a referral bonus. Keep the application open and process it weekly, not in batches.

### 2. Onboarding in under 10 business days

Every day between application and first assignment is a day your candidate might take another job. Audit your onboarding process. How many steps does it take? Background checks, fingerprinting, orientation, system training, payroll setup. Map the whole thing.

Most districts take 3-6 weeks to get a sub from application to classroom. The best ones do it in 7-10 business days. That speed advantage translates directly into pool size.

### 3. Active retention

A sub who works one assignment and never comes back is a recruitment cost with no return. Track your 30-day and 90-day retention rates. If a sub has not worked in 30 days, someone should call them. Not a generic email. A phone call.

Build a sub engagement program: monthly check-ins, feedback surveys after assignments, recognition for reliability. Subs who feel like part of the team work more frequently and stay longer.

### 4. A feedback loop that tells you where the system breaks

Why did 40 subs go inactive last quarter? You do not know because nobody asked. Create a simple exit survey. Call subs who stopped accepting jobs. Track the reasons and categorize them: pay, school experience, scheduling conflicts, found other work, poor communication.

When you see patterns, fix them. If subs consistently cite poor experiences at certain schools, address those schools. If pay is the issue, benchmark against neighboring districts.

## What to measure

- **Pool size** (active subs who have worked in the last 30 days)
- **Application-to-classroom time** (target: under 10 business days)
- **30-day and 90-day retention rates**
- **Monthly recruitment volume** (new subs added per month)
- **Attrition reasons** (categorized and tracked quarterly)
- **Pool-to-need ratio** (active subs divided by average daily absences)

<div class="mistakes-box">

## Common mistakes

- **Counting total pool size instead of active pool size.** A list of 500 subs means nothing if only 200 have worked in the last 60 days.
- **Recruiting once a year.** September-only recruitment guarantees a spring shortage.
- **Making onboarding slow and painful.** If your process takes a month, you are losing candidates to faster districts.
- **Never asking why subs leave.** You cannot fix what you do not measure.
- **Treating all subs the same.** Your top 20% of subs fill 60% of your jobs. Know who they are and treat them accordingly.

**If you only do one thing this week:** Pull your substitute pool data and calculate your active rate: how many subs on your roster have worked at least one day in the last 30 days? Divide that by your total roster. If the number is below 50%, your pipeline has a retention problem, not a recruitment problem.
