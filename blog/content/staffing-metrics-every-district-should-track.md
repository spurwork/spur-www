Ask most HR directors how many vacancies they have. They can tell you immediately. Ask them their pool activation rate, their cost per unfilled absence, or their offer acceptance rate, and you get silence. This is not a criticism of HR directors. It is a symptom of districts measuring the most visible metric while ignoring the most actionable ones.

<div class="direct-answer">

A complete district staffing scorecard includes ten metrics across four categories: workforce stability (retention rate, vacancy rate, time to fill), substitute program health (fill rate, pool activation rate, sub performance score), recruitment effectiveness (applicants per opening, offer acceptance rate, source of hire), and cost efficiency (cost per hire, cost per unfilled absence). Tracking these ten metrics monthly provides complete visibility into staffing health and enables proactive management. Most districts track two or three. The districts that track all ten make consistently better staffing decisions.

## The ten metrics

### Workforce stability

**1. Teacher retention rate.** The percentage of teachers who return from one year to the next. Track this by building, subject area, and years of experience. The overall number hides critical variation. A 90% district retention rate can include a building at 70% that needs urgent attention.

**2. Vacancy rate.** The number of unfilled teaching positions as a percentage of total positions. Track this at three points: August 1 (pre-year), October 1 (after the year starts), and January 1 (mid-year). Vacancies that persist past October indicate structural recruitment problems.

**3. Time to fill.** The average number of days from when a position is posted to when an offer is accepted. This measures your hiring speed. In competitive labor markets, time to fill is a critical competitive metric. Every extra week costs you candidates.

### Substitute program health

**4. Fill rate.** The percentage of teacher absences covered by a substitute. Track this daily and report it weekly. Break it down by building, day of week, and time of request. The aggregate fill rate is useful. The building-specific and time-specific data is actionable.

**5. Pool activation rate.** The percentage of rostered subs who accepted at least one assignment in the last 30 days. This is the gap between your paper pool and your real pool. Most districts find 40-60% of their rostered subs are functionally inactive.

**6. Sub performance score.** The average post-assignment rating for your substitute pool, aggregated from teacher feedback. This tells you whether your subs are maintaining classroom quality. A declining average performance score is an early warning.

### Recruitment effectiveness

**7. Applicants per opening.** The number of applications received for each posted position. Track this by subject area and building. Positions that consistently attract fewer than three applicants need targeted recruitment strategies beyond standard job postings.

**8. Offer acceptance rate.** The percentage of employment offers that are accepted. A low acceptance rate means you are attracting candidates but losing them at the decision point. This often indicates a compensation or working conditions gap that becomes apparent during the interview process.

**9. Source of hire.** Which recruitment channels produce your actual hires? Job boards, university partnerships, referrals, internal pipelines, or other sources? This data tells you where to invest recruitment resources and where to reduce spending.

### Cost efficiency

**10. Cost per unfilled absence.** When a classroom goes uncovered, what does it actually cost? Include: pulled instructional coaches (their hourly rate), lost teacher prep periods (opportunity cost), combined classroom inefficiency, and administrative time spent managing coverage. This number makes the business case for investing in fill rate improvements.

## Building the scorecard

### Start with what you have

Most of these metrics can be calculated from data you already collect. Absence management systems generate fill rate data. HRIS systems have vacancy and turnover data. The work is not generating new data. It is pulling existing data together into a single view.

### Update monthly

Weekly updates for fill rate and absence data. Monthly updates for all ten metrics. Quarterly deep-dive analysis that examines trends and triggers action.

### Share widely

The scorecard should not live in HR. Share it with the superintendent, principals, and the school board (in appropriate summary form). When staffing data is as visible as academic data, staffing receives the same level of strategic attention.

### Set targets

Each metric should have a target. Fill rate: 90%. Retention rate: 90%. Time to fill: 30 days. Targets create accountability and provide a clear benchmark for evaluating whether strategies are working.

<div class="metrics-box">

## The complete scorecard

- **Teacher retention rate** (target: 90%+, by building and subject area)
- **Vacancy rate** (target: below 3% by October 1)
- **Time to fill** (target: under 30 days)
- **Fill rate** (target: 85-90%, by building and day of week)
- **Pool activation rate** (target: 50%+)
- **Sub performance score** (target: above 2.5 on a 3-point scale)
- **Applicants per opening** (target: 5+ for every position)
- **Offer acceptance rate** (target: 80%+)
- **Source of hire** (no target; informational for resource allocation)
- **Cost per unfilled absence** (calculate once, use to build ROI cases)

<div class="mistakes-box">

## Common mistakes

- **Tracking only vacancies.** Vacancies are a lagging indicator. Fill rate, retention, and pipeline metrics are leading indicators. Track both.
- **Reporting data without targets.** "Our fill rate is 78%" means nothing without context. "Our fill rate is 78% against an 90% target, down from 82% last quarter" is actionable.
- **Not breaking down by building.** District averages hide building crises. Every metric should be viewable at the building level.
- **Reviewing annually instead of monthly.** Staffing problems develop in weeks. Annual reviews arrive too late to prevent damage.

**If you only do one thing this week:** Calculate three numbers: your current fill rate, your current teacher retention rate, and your pool activation rate. Write them on a sticky note and put it on your monitor. Those three numbers are the foundation of your staffing scorecard. Next week, add two more.
