You onboarded 50 new subs in August. By December, 20 are active. By February, 12. The rest drifted away quietly. No dramatic exit. No angry email. They just stopped accepting assignments. This pattern repeats in districts across the country, and most districts never ask the obvious question: why did they leave?

<div class="direct-answer">

Substitute teacher attrition is consistently high across most districts, with many losing the majority of newly onboarded subs within a single school year. The top reasons substitutes leave are: negative building experiences (poor treatment by staff, chaotic classrooms, no support), inconsistent work availability, late or inaccurate pay, and feeling like disposable labor rather than valued professionals. Districts that reduce sub attrition focus on three areas: improving the daily building experience, ensuring reliable pay and scheduling, and creating a sense of belonging and professional identity for their substitute pool.

## The real reasons subs leave

### 1. A bad day at a bad school

One terrible experience at one school can end a sub's career in your district. They arrive and nobody knows they are coming. There are no lesson plans. Students are out of control. No administrator checks in. By 3:00 PM, they have decided this is not worth $130.

The insidious part: this does not happen at every school. Your best schools provide great sub experiences. Your worst schools drive subs away from the entire district. One building's failure becomes a district-wide retention problem.

### 2. Pay problems

Nothing erodes trust faster than a paycheck that is wrong or late. Subs often live on tight margins. A pay error that takes two weeks to resolve is not a minor inconvenience. It is a crisis. Districts that pay biweekly instead of monthly, process timesheets quickly, and resolve errors within 48 hours retain more subs.

### 3. Lack of professional identity

In many districts, subs exist in a professional no-man's-land. They are not teachers. They are not staff. They attend no professional development. They receive no feedback. They are not invited to staff meetings or school events. This invisibility makes it easy to walk away because there is nothing to walk away from.

### 4. Scheduling unpredictability

Some subs want to work every day. Others want two or three days per week. When the scheduling system does not match subs with their preferred availability, they become frustrated. A sub who wants to work Monday through Wednesday but keeps getting offered Thursday and Friday assignments will eventually stop checking the system.

## How to keep your best subs

### Fix the building experience first

Audit the sub experience at every building. Send a brief post-assignment survey after each assignment. "How was your day at Lincoln Elementary? Were lesson plans available? Did someone greet you? Would you return?" Track results by building.

When a building consistently receives poor ratings, intervene with that building's leadership. The goal is not to punish schools but to bring every building up to a minimum standard.

### Create a sub advisory council

Invite your most active subs to a quarterly meeting. Ask them what is working and what is not. Listen. Then act on what you hear. This accomplishes two things: you get real intelligence about the sub experience, and you create a core group of subs who feel invested in the program.

### Offer professional development

Include subs in relevant district professional development opportunities. Classroom management workshops, de-escalation training, and curriculum overviews make subs more effective and signal that the district values their growth.

### Recognize and reward loyalty

Identify your top 20% of subs by assignment volume and building ratings. Recognize them publicly. Offer them first pick of long-term assignments. Provide a loyalty bonus: after 50 assignments in a year, a $500 bonus. After 100, $1,000. The cost is minimal compared to the cost of constantly recruiting replacements.

### Ensure accurate, timely pay

Audit your payroll process for subs. How often are there errors? How long do corrections take? Is the pay schedule clear and consistent? Fix every friction point. Subs talk to each other. A reputation for pay problems spreads through your pool faster than any recruitment campaign can offset.

## What to measure

- **Sub attrition rate** (percentage of onboarded subs who become inactive within 6 months)
- **Assignment acceptance rate** (of offers made, what percentage are accepted?)
- **Post-assignment survey scores by building** (identify buildings that drive subs away)
- **Payroll error rate** (percentage of sub pay periods with errors)
- **Pool longevity** (average tenure of active subs in months)

<div class="mistakes-box">

## Common mistakes

- **Focusing only on recruitment while ignoring retention.** Recruiting 50 new subs to replace 40 who left is a treadmill, not a strategy.
- **Not surveying subs about their experience.** You cannot fix what you do not measure. Ask subs how their day went.
- **Tolerating bad building experiences.** One school that mistreats subs poisons your entire district pool.
- **Treating all subs the same regardless of performance.** Your best subs should get the best assignments and the most recognition.

**If you only do one thing this week:** Send a two-question survey to every sub who worked in your district this month. "How was your experience? Would you recommend subbing in our district to a friend?" The answers will tell you exactly where to focus.
