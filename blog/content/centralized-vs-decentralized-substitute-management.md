I have worked with districts on both sides of this debate. Schools that manage their own subs swear by the personal relationships. Central offices that run a unified system point to their fill rates. Both have valid arguments. But the data tilts clearly in one direction.

<div class="direct-answer">

Centralized substitute management systems consistently outperform decentralized approaches on fill rate, cost efficiency, and data visibility. Districts that centralize sub placement typically achieve 8-15 percentage points higher fill rates than those that leave it to individual buildings. The key advantage is pooling: a centralized system can redirect subs from low-need schools to high-need schools on any given day. Decentralized systems cannot. However, centralization works only when paired with building-level relationships and school-specific onboarding.

## How each model works

### The decentralized model

Each school manages its own substitute pool. The principal or office manager calls their preferred subs directly. Schools build personal relationships with regulars who know the building. When it works, it works well. The sub knows the kids, knows the routines, and hits the ground running.

The problem: it falls apart on high-absence days. When three teachers are out simultaneously, the school's small pool is exhausted. There is no mechanism to pull from a larger district pool. The result is uncovered classrooms, split classes, and pulled specialists.

### The centralized model

The district maintains a single substitute pool. A central office team assigns subs to buildings based on need. Schools submit absence requests to the system. The system fills them from the shared pool.

The advantage: scale. A district with 40 schools and 200 active subs can distribute resources far more efficiently than 40 schools each managing 15-20 preferred subs.

## Why centralization wins on the numbers

### 1. Pool utilization

In a decentralized system, Sub A might prefer School 1 and only works there. On a day School 1 has no absences, Sub A stays home. Meanwhile, School 2 has three uncovered classrooms. A centralized system would route Sub A to School 2.

Districts that centralize report 20-30% higher pool utilization rates. More of your subs work more of the time.

### 2. Data visibility

When each school manages its own subs, the district has no aggregate view of fill rates, sub performance, or absence patterns. Centralization creates a single data source. You can see which schools struggle, which subs perform well, and where your gaps are.

### 3. Cost control

Decentralized systems often result in duplicate spending. Multiple schools recruit and onboard the same subs independently. Centralized systems onboard once and deploy everywhere.

### 4. Consistency across buildings

Without centralization, schools with strong office staff build better sub pools. Schools with overwhelmed offices get what is left. Centralized systems can balance coverage across all buildings.

## Making centralization work

Centralization fails when it ignores what makes decentralization attractive: relationships.

### Keep building-level preferences

Allow schools to flag preferred subs. The central system should prioritize those preferences when possible. A sub who knows a building is more effective than a stranger.

### Maintain school-specific onboarding

Centralized placement does not mean generic placement. Every sub should still receive a building orientation. The central system assigns. The building welcomes.

### Use technology to streamline, not dehumanize

Modern absence management platforms handle the logistics. Calls, texts, and app notifications fill positions faster than phone trees. But someone at each building should still greet the sub by name when they arrive.

### Give principals visibility

Principals resist centralization when they feel they have lost control. Give them dashboard access to see who is coming to their building, when, and how the sub was rated by other schools.

## What to measure

- **District-wide fill rate** (compare before and after centralization)
- **Fill rate consistency across schools** (standard deviation of fill rates between buildings)
- **Pool utilization rate** (percentage of active subs who work at least once per week)
- **Time to fill** (how quickly absences are covered after being reported)
- **Sub-to-school loyalty rate** (percentage of subs who work at the same school repeatedly)

<div class="mistakes-box">

## Common mistakes

- **Centralizing placement without centralizing onboarding.** If the central office assigns subs but nobody trains them on each building, quality suffers.
- **Ignoring school preferences entirely.** Principals who feel overridden will work around the system. Build preferences into the algorithm.
- **Centralizing without technology.** A central office managing 200 subs with spreadsheets and phone calls will fail. Invest in the platform first.
- **Not communicating the change.** Teachers and principals need to understand why the model is changing and how it benefits their building.

**If you only do one thing this week:** Pull your fill rate data by building for the last semester. If the gap between your highest-performing and lowest-performing school is more than 20 percentage points, you have a consistency problem that centralization can solve.
