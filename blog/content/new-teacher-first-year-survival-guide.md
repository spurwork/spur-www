A new teacher walks into their classroom for the first time in August. They have a degree, a certification, student teaching experience, and absolutely no idea how to navigate the daily logistics of an actual school. Where do I make copies? How does the grade book work? What do I do when a student refuses to leave the room? Who do I call when the projector breaks?

These are not trivial questions. They are the questions that consume a new teacher's first weeks and months, crowd out instructional focus, and create the overwhelming feeling that leads 25% of new teachers to leave within three years.

<div class="direct-answer">

First-year teacher attrition is a significant and costly problem: approximately 10% of new teachers leave after their first year, and 25% leave within three years. Research shows that comprehensive onboarding before the school year starts, covering logistics, culture, curriculum, and relational support, significantly reduces early attrition. The most effective programs begin two to three weeks before the first student day and include building-specific orientation, mentorship pairing, curriculum overview, classroom setup time, and explicit instruction in the unwritten rules that veteran teachers take for granted.

## What new teachers need before day one

### 1. Building-specific logistics

Every school has its own rhythms, systems, and unwritten rules. New teachers need a building orientation that covers: how to access the building before and after hours, copy machine procedures, supply request process, technology systems and passwords, discipline referral process, emergency procedures, and who to call for what.

Create a one-page "who handles what" directory. The copy machine is broken: call Dave. A student is in crisis: call Ms. Rodriguez. Your grade book is not working: email tech support at this address. This document alone reduces first-week anxiety dramatically.

### 2. Curriculum orientation

A new teacher needs to understand what they are teaching, what materials are available, and how their school approaches curriculum. Schedule time before school starts for new teachers to meet with grade-level or department colleagues. Walk through the first unit together. Show them where materials are located. Answer the questions they are afraid to ask in a larger group.

### 3. Classroom setup time

Give new teachers dedicated time to set up their classroom. This sounds simple, but many districts schedule new teacher orientation right up until the first student day, leaving no time for this essential preparation. New teachers who enter day one with an organized, personalized classroom feel more confident and in control.

### 4. Mentor introduction and initial meeting

Pair every new teacher with a mentor before the year starts. The first meeting should happen during orientation, not during the chaos of the first week. Establish meeting times, communication norms, and the scope of the mentoring relationship before it is needed.

### 5. The unwritten rules

Every school has them. The teachers' lounge is where people vent; do not repeat what you hear. The principal prefers email over drop-ins. The custodian controls who gets the good supplies, and being friendly to them is not optional. Mrs. Chen down the hall is the person who knows everything and will help anyone who asks.

Veteran teachers navigate these invisible systems effortlessly. New teachers stumble through them painfully. A 30-minute conversation with a veteran colleague about the unwritten rules of the building saves months of awkward learning.

## The first semester: structured support

### Weeks 1-2: Daily check-ins

A mentor, instructional coach, or administrator should check in with every new teacher daily during the first two weeks. Not a formal meeting. A two-minute stop-by: "How was today? What do you need?" This frequency communicates that the new teacher is not alone.

### Weeks 3-6: Weekly structured meetings

Shift to weekly 30-minute meetings with the mentor. Focus on immediate challenges: a difficult class period, a parent who is upset, a lesson that fell apart. The mentor's role is to normalize struggle, share strategies, and reassure.

### Months 2-4: Observation and feedback

New teachers should observe veteran teachers at least twice and receive non-evaluative observation from their mentor at least twice. This reciprocal observation is the highest-leverage professional development for a first-year teacher.

### Months 5-9: Gradual release

As the new teacher gains confidence, shift from support to professional growth. What instructional strategies do they want to develop? What professional goals do they have? The mentor relationship evolves from crisis management to coaching.

## What to measure

- **First-year retention rate** (what percentage of new hires complete year one?)
- **New teacher satisfaction survey** (quarterly, focused on support quality)
- **Mentor meeting frequency** (are meetings happening as scheduled?)
- **Onboarding program completion** (did new teachers complete all orientation components?)
- **Time to effectiveness** (how quickly do new teachers reach proficiency on classroom observations?)

<div class="mistakes-box">

## Common mistakes

- **Scheduling orientation with no classroom setup time.** New teachers need time in their classroom before students arrive. Protect this time.
- **Covering only logistics and ignoring culture.** Knowing how the copy machine works is important. Knowing the unwritten rules of the building is more important.
- **Assigning a mentor and never checking whether they meet.** A mentor assignment is not a mentoring relationship. Verify that meetings are happening.
- **Treating new teacher support as a first-semester initiative.** The second semester is when burnout hits hardest. Support should extend through the full first year and taper in year two.

**If you only do one thing this week:** Ask each of your first-year teachers to list the three things they wish someone had told them before day one. Compile the answers. Add them to next year's orientation. Each year, this exercise makes your onboarding stronger.
