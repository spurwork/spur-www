You enrolled 300 students in your summer program. By week three, 180 are showing up. By week five, it is 120. This attendance cliff is one of the most predictable problems in summer programming, and one of the most solvable.

<div class="direct-answer">

Summer program attendance drops substantially between enrollment and the final week, and this pattern is one of the most consistent challenges in summer programming. Research on summer learning programs consistently finds that students who attend the majority of sessions show measurable academic gains, while those with low attendance show almost none. The key drivers of sustained attendance are program quality (activities students actually enjoy), transportation access, family communication, and a sense of belonging from day one.

## Why attendance drops and what to do about it

### 1. Make the first three days unforgettable

Students decide in the first week whether a program is worth their time. Front-load your most engaging activities, your strongest facilitators, and your most fun programming into days one through three. Build relationships immediately. Learn every student's name by day two.

### 2. Solve transportation before the program starts

Transportation is the number one logistical barrier to summer attendance. If a family cannot get their child to the program, nothing else matters. Survey families during enrollment about transportation needs. Provide bus routes, partner with local transit, or organize carpools. Every student should have a confirmed ride before day one.

### 3. Communicate with families weekly

A weekly text or call to families with a program update, upcoming highlights, and a personal note about their child keeps attendance top of mind. "Marcus had a great week in the robotics lab. Next week we are starting the bridge-building project." That message takes 30 seconds and keeps Marcus coming back.

### 4. Build choice into the schedule

Students who feel forced into activities disengage. Build at least 30% of your program around student-chosen activities. Interest surveys during the first week help you tailor offerings. If half your students want more sports and you are offering two hours of worksheets, you will lose them.

### 5. Track attendance daily and intervene immediately

Do not wait until a student has missed three days. Call the family after the first absence. "We missed Jasmine today. Is everything okay? We want to make sure she does not miss tomorrow's field trip." Early intervention prevents the slow fade that turns into dropout.

## What to measure

- **Daily attendance rate** (track the trend line, not just the average)
- **Attendance by week** (identify exactly when the drop-off happens)
- **75% attendance threshold** (what percentage of enrolled students attend at least 75% of sessions?)
- **Reasons for absence** (transportation, competing activities, disengagement, family circumstances)
- **Student satisfaction survey** (weekly, three questions max)

<div class="mistakes-box">

## Common mistakes

- **Front-loading academic content and back-loading fun activities.** Students decide early. Lead with engagement.
- **Not solving transportation.** If you build it, they will come, only if they can get there.
- **Waiting until week three to address attendance drops.** By then, the habit of not attending is set.
- **Making the program feel like regular school.** Summer programs that replicate the school-year experience fail to attract the students who need them most.

**If you only do one thing this week:** Pull your attendance data from day one through the last day of your most recent summer program. Plot it on a line chart. Find the steepest drop. That is when you are losing students, and understanding when helps you understand why.
