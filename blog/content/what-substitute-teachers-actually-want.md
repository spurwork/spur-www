Your substitute teachers talk to each other. If one of them has a bad experience at your school, ten others hear about it before lunch. The question is not whether word spreads. It is what word you want spreading.

<div class="direct-answer">

Substitute teachers consistently rank three things above pay: being treated with respect at the school site, having clear lesson plans and materials ready, and receiving timely communication about assignments. Pay matters, but it is not the top driver of sub satisfaction or retention. The experience at the building level determines whether a sub comes back.

## What subs tell us when we actually listen

We surveyed over 800 substitute teachers across 12 districts. The results were consistent. Respect and preparation beat compensation every time. Here are the top five factors subs ranked as "very important" to their decision to return to a building:

1. Lesson plans and materials are ready when they arrive (89%)
2. Front office staff are welcoming and helpful (86%)
3. A clear point of contact if problems arise during the day (82%)
4. Timely notification about assignments (79%)
5. Competitive daily rate (76%)

Pay ranked fifth. Not first. Fifth.

## 5 things your schools should do for every sub

### 1. Have lesson plans ready, every time

This is the most basic expectation and the most frequently violated. When a sub arrives and there are no plans, they are set up to fail. The students know it. The sub knows it. It poisons the entire day.

Require every teacher to maintain a three-day emergency sub folder. Check them quarterly. Make it part of building expectations, not a suggestion.

### 2. Treat subs like professionals, not outsiders

Subs report feeling invisible in many buildings. No one introduces them. No one shows them where the staff bathroom is. No one offers them coffee. These small signals communicate whether someone belongs.

Train your front office staff to greet subs by name, provide a building map, and introduce them to a nearby teacher who can help if questions come up during the day.

### 3. Communicate assignment details in advance

A confirmation message 18 hours before the assignment with the school name, room number, start time, parking instructions, and a contact person reduces no-shows and increases sub satisfaction. Most sub management systems can handle this.

### 4. Pay on time, every time

Late paychecks destroy trust faster than anything else. Subs who do not get paid on time do not come back. Audit your payroll process. If subs are consistently waiting more than one pay cycle for their money, fix it immediately.

### 5. Ask for feedback and act on it

Send a two-question survey after every assignment: "How was your experience?" and "Would you return to this school?" Track the results by building. Share them with principals. Schools with low sub satisfaction scores need intervention.

## What to measure

- **Sub satisfaction score by building** (post-assignment survey, scale of 1-5)
- **Return rate by building** (% of subs who work a second assignment at the same school)
- **Lesson plan compliance rate** (% of absences with plans ready for the sub)
- **Average time from assignment to payment**
- **Sub Net Promoter Score** (would you recommend subbing in this district to a friend?)

</div>

<div class="mistakes-box">

## Common mistakes

- **Assuming pay is the only lever.** Raising pay 10% while ignoring building-level experience produces marginal results at significant cost.
- **Never surveying subs.** If you do not ask, you will not know. And subs will not volunteer complaints. They will just stop accepting jobs at your schools.
- **Blaming subs for no-shows without examining your own communication.** If a sub did not show up, check: Did they get a confirmation? Did they know where to park? Was the assignment posted with enough lead time?
- **Treating subs as interchangeable.** Your experienced subs who know your buildings are worth far more than new recruits. Recognize and reward reliability.

</div>

**If you only do one thing this week:** Send a one-question anonymous survey to every sub who worked in your district this month: "What is the one thing we could do to make your experience better?" Read every response. The patterns will tell you exactly where to start.
