June arrives. Teachers clean out classrooms. Contracts are signed or not renewed. Retirees say goodbye. And then summer swallows the institutional memory of what happened during the year. When August arrives, the district starts fresh with the same problems it ended with because nobody documented, analyzed, or planned based on the staffing data from the year that just ended.

An end-of-year staffing review takes one week of focused work and sets the direction for the next twelve months.

<div class="direct-answer">

A structured end-of-year staffing review captures critical data, identifies patterns, and generates a staffing action plan for the coming year. The review should cover five areas: workforce stability (who left and why), substitute program performance (fill rates, pool health, quality data), recruitment effectiveness (what worked and what did not), budget utilization (where was staffing money spent and what was the return), and pipeline development (is the future talent supply growing or shrinking). Districts that conduct annual staffing reviews and act on the findings show year-over-year improvement on key metrics. Districts that do not repeat the same problems indefinitely.

## The five-part review

### Part 1: Workforce stability

**What to analyze:**
- Total turnover number and rate (compare to prior years)
- Turnover by building (which schools lost the most teachers?)
- Turnover by experience level (are you losing new teachers, mid-career, or veterans?)
- Turnover by subject area (which subjects have chronic retention problems?)
- Exit interview themes (what reasons appear most frequently?)

**Questions to answer:**
- Was turnover higher or lower than last year? Why?
- Which buildings need leadership intervention based on retention patterns?
- Are your retention strategies (mentoring, compensation, culture initiatives) producing measurable results?

### Part 2: Substitute program performance

**What to analyze:**
- Annual fill rate (monthly trend line)
- Fill rate by building (which schools performed best and worst?)
- Pool size changes (did the active pool grow or shrink?)
- Sub performance data (average quality ratings, top and bottom performers)
- No-show rate (trend and building distribution)
- Cost per sub day and cost per unfilled absence

**Questions to answer:**
- Did fill rates improve, decline, or hold steady?
- Is the substitute pool healthy enough for next year or does it need rebuilding?
- What building-level interventions are needed to improve sub experiences?

### Part 3: Recruitment effectiveness

**What to analyze:**
- Positions posted, applications received, offers made, offers accepted
- Time to fill by position type
- Source of hire (which channels produced actual hires?)
- Quality of new hires (how did this year's new teachers perform?)
- Recruitment spending by channel (cost per hire from each source)

**Questions to answer:**
- Which recruitment strategies produced results and which did not?
- Where should recruitment resources be invested next year?
- Are there positions that were chronically hard to fill? What is the plan?

### Part 4: Budget utilization

**What to analyze:**
- Total staffing-related spending (recruitment, substitutes, retention initiatives, technology)
- ROI on specific investments (did the mentoring program reduce turnover? Did the pay increase improve fill rates?)
- Cost of staffing gaps (substitute costs, coverage costs, overtime, pulled specialists)
- Budget vs. actual for staffing line items

**Questions to answer:**
- Where did staffing dollars produce the most value?
- Where was money spent with little measurable return?
- What is the recommended staffing budget for next year?

### Part 5: Pipeline development

**What to analyze:**
- Student teacher placements this year (how many, and how many converted to hires?)
- Alternative certification program participants (how many in the pipeline?)
- Grow-your-own program status (enrollment, completion, certification progress)
- University partnership health (are feeder programs growing or shrinking?)
- Substitute-to-teacher conversions (how many subs became certified teachers?)

**Questions to answer:**
- Is the talent pipeline growing or shrinking?
- Which pipeline programs need more investment?
- What is the projected pipeline output for the next three years?

## Turning the review into a plan

### Set three to five staffing goals for next year

Based on the review, identify the highest-priority staffing improvements. Be specific: "Improve fill rate from 78% to 85%" is better than "improve substitute program." "Reduce first-year teacher turnover by 20%" is better than "improve retention."

### Assign ownership

Each goal needs a specific person responsible for achieving it, a timeline, and a budget. Goals without ownership are wishes.

### Schedule quarterly check-ins

Review progress on staffing goals quarterly. Do not wait until next June to discover that the plan stalled in October. Quarterly reviews create accountability and enable course corrections.

## What to measure

- **Year-over-year comparison** (is each metric improving, declining, or stable?)
- **Goal achievement rate** (of last year's staffing goals, how many were met?)
- **ROI on staffing investments** (which expenditures produced measurable returns?)
- **Pipeline yield** (how many certified teachers will the pipeline produce in the next 1, 2, and 3 years?)
- **Action plan completion** (are review findings being acted on?)

<div class="mistakes-box">

## Common mistakes

- **Not conducting a review at all.** Most districts do not. This means starting every year at the same place rather than building on progress.
- **Reviewing data without setting goals.** Analysis without action planning is an academic exercise.
- **Setting goals without assigning ownership.** Unowned goals are forgotten by August.
- **Losing institutional knowledge over summer.** Document everything before June. The review is the institutional memory.

</div>

**If you only do one thing this week:** Block four hours in June for a staffing review meeting. Invite your HR director, your substitute program coordinator, and one principal. Pull the data for each of the five sections above. Four hours of analysis in June prevents twelve months of repeating last year's mistakes.
