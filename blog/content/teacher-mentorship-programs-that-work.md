Every district I know has a mentorship program on paper. A new teacher is assigned a mentor. They meet a few times. The mentor answers questions when asked. By November, both are too busy to meet regularly. By January, the mentorship exists in name only. The new teacher struggles alone, and in March they start looking at job postings in other districts.

This is not mentorship. It is a checkbox.

<div class="direct-answer">

Structured teacher mentorship programs reduce first-year teacher attrition by 25-50% compared to unstructured or absent programs. The critical elements are: careful mentor selection (not just seniority, but skill and disposition), protected time for regular meetings (weekly in the first semester, biweekly in the second), a focus on instructional practice rather than logistics, and administrative support that treats mentorship as a priority rather than an add-on. The most effective programs also compensate mentors, provide mentor training, and include classroom observation cycles.

## Why most mentorship programs fail

### The pairing is random

Assigning the teacher next door as a mentor because of proximity is convenient but often ineffective. Good mentors are skilled at coaching, emotionally intelligent, patient, and willing to be vulnerable about their own struggles. These qualities do not correlate with seniority or physical location in the building.

### There is no structure

"Meet when you can" means "meet when nothing else comes up," which in a school means never. Effective mentorship requires a calendar, a curriculum, and accountability. Without structure, even well-intentioned mentors and mentees drift apart.

### Mentorship focuses on survival, not growth

Most informal mentorship devolves into the new teacher asking logistical questions: how to submit grades, where to find supplies, how to handle a fire drill. These are important but insufficient. Real mentorship is about instructional practice: lesson planning, formative assessment, classroom management strategies, and analyzing student work.

### Mentors are not trained or compensated

Being a great teacher does not automatically make someone a great mentor. Mentoring is a distinct skill set that includes active listening, non-evaluative feedback, and the ability to guide without directing. Districts that invest in mentor training see dramatically better outcomes. Districts that also compensate mentors ($1,000-$3,000 per year is typical) signal that the role matters.

## What effective mentorship looks like

### Month one: Daily check-ins, weekly observations

The first month is critical. Mentors should check in daily, even if only for five minutes. Weekly classroom observations (mentor observes new teacher and new teacher observes mentor) establish the norm that professional learning is public and ongoing.

### Months two through four: Weekly structured meetings

Move to weekly 30-45 minute meetings with a loose agenda: what is working, what is challenging, one specific instructional strategy to try this week. The mentor's role is to listen more than tell.

### Months five through nine: Biweekly meetings and peer observation

As the new teacher gains confidence, shift to biweekly meetings. Introduce peer observation with other teachers, not just the mentor. This expands the new teacher's professional network and prevents over-dependence on a single mentor.

### Throughout: Focus on instruction

Every meeting should include at least one conversation about teaching and learning. What are students understanding? What are they missing? How do you know? What will you try differently? These questions keep the mentorship grounded in the work that matters most.

## What to measure

- **Meeting frequency and duration** (are pairs actually meeting as scheduled?)
- **New teacher retention at one and two years** (compare mentored vs. unmentored cohorts)
- **New teacher satisfaction survey** (specifically about mentorship quality)
- **Mentor satisfaction survey** (are mentors finding the work meaningful or burdensome?)
- **Instructional growth** (observation data for mentored teachers vs. comparison group)

<div class="mistakes-box">

## Common mistakes

- **Pairing based on convenience rather than compatibility.** Proximity and subject area matter less than coaching skill and personal chemistry.
- **Not protecting meeting time.** If mentorship meetings are the first thing canceled when something comes up, the message is clear: mentorship is not a priority.
- **Using mentors as evaluators.** The moment a mentor's feedback affects a new teacher's evaluation, trust is destroyed. Keep mentorship and evaluation completely separate.
- **Ending the program after year one.** Second-year teachers still need support. Taper the program rather than cutting it off abruptly.

**If you only do one thing this week:** Ask each of your first-year teachers one question: "When was the last time your mentor observed your teaching?" If the answer is "never" or "not since September," your program needs structural intervention.
