Every week I talk to a district that just spent $100,000 on a staffing platform they do not use. The demo was impressive. The sales team was convincing. The contract was signed. Six months later, the system sits half-implemented while the office staff quietly returns to their spreadsheets and phone trees.

This is not a technology failure. It is an evaluation failure. The district bought a solution to a problem they had not fully defined, from a vendor they had not thoroughly vetted, with an implementation plan that did not account for their actual workflow.

<div class="direct-answer">

Effective staffing technology evaluation requires defining your specific problems before looking at solutions, involving end users in the evaluation process, testing with your actual data and workflows, and assessing the vendor's implementation support and track record with similar districts. The most common evaluation mistakes are: letting the vendor define the problem, evaluating features instead of outcomes, and failing to account for implementation complexity. A structured evaluation process takes four to six weeks and saves districts from six-figure mistakes.

## Before you look at a single product

### Define the problem precisely

"We need better staffing software" is not a problem statement. "Our fill rate is 72%, and we believe the primary causes are slow notification speed, limited sub pool visibility, and inability to track preferences" is a problem statement. The more precisely you define the problem, the more effectively you can evaluate whether a given solution addresses it.

### Identify your must-haves vs. nice-to-haves

Create two lists. Must-haves are the features without which the system is a non-starter: integration with your HRIS, absence notification, mobile-friendly sub interface. Nice-to-haves are desirable but not required: advanced analytics, smart matching, custom reporting.

Most districts do the opposite: they create a wish list of every possible feature and evaluate vendors against a 50-item checklist. This leads to selecting the platform with the most features rather than the one that solves your specific problem.

### Map your current workflow

Before evaluating new technology, document your current workflow in detail. How are absences reported? Who notifies subs? How are assignments confirmed? What happens when a position goes unfilled? Where are the bottlenecks?

This map serves two purposes: it helps you evaluate whether a new system actually improves your workflow, and it helps the vendor configure the system to match how your district operates.

## The evaluation process

### 1. Start with references, not demos

Before watching a demo, ask the vendor for references from three districts similar to yours in size and context. Call those districts. Ask: What problem did this solve? What did implementation look like? What surprised you? Would you buy it again?

References provide ground truth that no demo can match. If a vendor cannot provide relevant references, that is a signal.

### 2. Test with your own data

A demo with perfect sample data always looks great. Request a pilot or proof of concept using your actual sub pool data, your actual absence patterns, and your actual building preferences. Seeing the system operate with your real-world complexity reveals issues that demo data hides.

### 3. Involve the end users

The people who will use the system daily, office staff, building secretaries, HR coordinators, should be in the evaluation from the start. Their feedback on usability, workflow fit, and practical limitations is more valuable than administrative assessment.

Ask end users: "Would this make your job easier?" If the answer is not an enthusiastic yes, the implementation will struggle.

### 4. Evaluate the vendor, not just the product

Technology is only as good as the support behind it. Assess the vendor on: implementation timeline and support, training resources, customer service responsiveness, product roadmap and update frequency, and financial stability.

A great product with poor implementation support will fail. A good product with excellent support will succeed.

### 5. Negotiate the contract carefully

Ensure the contract includes: a defined implementation timeline with milestones, training for all user groups, a trial period with the option to exit, clear pricing for the full term including any per-user or per-building fees, and data portability (you own your data).

Avoid multi-year contracts without exit clauses. The first year is a test. If the system does not deliver the expected outcomes, you should be able to leave.

## What to measure

- **Baseline metrics before implementation** (fill rate, time to fill, admin hours spent, sub satisfaction)
- **Same metrics at 90, 180, and 365 days post-implementation** (is the system delivering improvement?)
- **User adoption rate** (what percentage of intended users are actually using the system?)
- **Support ticket volume and resolution time** (is the vendor responsive?)
- **ROI calculation** (cost of the system vs. measurable improvements in efficiency and outcomes)

</div>

<div class="mistakes-box">

## Common mistakes

- **Letting the vendor run the evaluation.** They will show you what they want you to see. Control the process.
- **Evaluating features instead of outcomes.** A 50-feature checklist does not help. "Will this improve our fill rate by 10 points?" does.
- **Not involving end users.** Systems that administrators love but office staff hate get abandoned within months.
- **Signing multi-year contracts before proving the system works.** Negotiate a trial period. Protect your exit options.

**If you only do one thing this week:** Write a one-paragraph problem statement describing your district's biggest staffing challenge. Be specific about the symptoms, the scale, and the impact. This paragraph is the starting point for any technology evaluation and will save you from buying a solution to the wrong problem.
