A substitute teacher walks into your building at 7:15 AM. They have never been there before. The front office is busy. Nobody greets them. They find the classroom on their own. There are no lesson plans on the desk. The students test them immediately. By 3:00 PM, they have decided to never return.

This happens in schools across the country every single day. And it is entirely preventable.

<div class="direct-answer">

Schools that implement a structured sub onboarding process, even a simple 15-minute building orientation, see significantly higher sub return rates. The checklist includes a greeting by name at the front office, a building map, lesson plan confirmation, a point-of-contact teacher, and basic logistics like parking, bathroom locations, and lunch procedures. Most schools do none of these consistently.

## The 15-minute sub orientation checklist

This is not complicated. It requires one trained front office staff member and 15 minutes. Every school should do this for every sub, every time.

### 1. Greet the sub by name

Check the schedule before they arrive. When they walk in, say their name. "Good morning, Ms. Rodriguez. Thanks for being here today." This takes three seconds and immediately signals that they are expected and valued.

### 2. Provide a building orientation packet

Create a one-page packet that includes: building map with their classroom highlighted, daily schedule with bell times, lunch procedure, emergency procedures, bathroom locations (staff and student), Wi-Fi password, and the name and room number of a "buddy teacher" nearby.

Print 20 copies and keep them at the front desk. This costs almost nothing.

### 3. Confirm lesson plans are in the classroom

Before the sub walks down the hall, call or text the classroom to confirm plans are there. If they are not, have a backup plan ready. Every building should maintain a set of emergency sub plans by grade level and subject.

### 4. Introduce the sub to a buddy teacher

Walk the sub to their classroom. On the way, introduce them to the teacher next door or across the hall. "This is Mr. Kim. He teaches the same grade level and can help if you have any questions during the day." This human connection is the single most important thing you can do.

### 5. Check in at lunch

Have someone from the front office or administration check in with the sub at lunchtime. "How is your day going? Is there anything you need?" This takes two minutes and communicates that someone cares.

### 6. Send a thank-you before they leave

At the end of the day, a quick "Thank you for being here today" from a staff member goes a long way. Some schools leave a handwritten thank-you note in the classroom before dismissal.

## What to measure

- **Sub return rate by building** (% of subs who work a second assignment at the same school)
- **Checklist completion rate** (are buildings consistently following the process?)
- **Sub satisfaction survey results** (post-assignment, one to two questions)
- **Lesson plan availability rate** (% of sub assignments with plans ready)

</div>

<div class="mistakes-box">

## Common mistakes

- **Assuming subs know your building.** They do not. Even experienced subs need orientation at a new site.
- **Making the front office responsible without training them.** If your secretary does not know the checklist exists, it will not get done.
- **Having no backup lesson plans.** When the teacher's plans are missing, the sub's day is ruined. Emergency plans prevent this.
- **Treating the checklist as optional.** If it only happens when the principal remembers, it is not a system. It is a hope.

**If you only do one thing this week:** Print a one-page building orientation packet for subs and put 20 copies at your front desk. Include a map, the daily schedule, and the name of a buddy teacher. That single sheet of paper will improve more sub experiences than any policy change.
